            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Northern Hope Foundation started as a Soup Kitchen for the elderly in early 2013. Founder, Pinky, saw the elderly waiting for their pension grant a short way away from her home and thought that while waiting must be terrible, there is nothing worse than waiting on an empty stomach. She took it upon herself to feed those in line.</p>
            <p>What she may not have known then, is how much of a rock to the community she would become. The Northern Hope Foundation, still ran by Pinky, has seen immense growth over the last 8 years. It is a registered NPO (non-profit organization) and has been established to aid the elderly, the young and the vulnerable in Ga-Rankuwa.</p>
            <p>The Northern Hope Foundation is a leader in the community mobilization to ensure that the community has easy access to information on HIV Prevention, care and support. In partnership with Phedisong 1 and 4 Clinic, the Northern Hope Foundation manages a Central Chronic Medicine Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) program on behalf of the Department of Health. This is done in partnership with Wits RHI as a support and mentoring partner.</p>
            <p>In addition, we are partnering with Withs RHI to reach out to communities and disseminate information on new HIV prevention methods, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for adolescent girls and young women and their partners. This programme is pioneered by community leaders like religious, traditional healers and political leaders.</p>
            <h3 class="objectives">Our Objectives</h3>
            <li>To deliver dignified services that impact on the lives of the community in Ga-Rankuwa and neighboring areas.</li>
            <li>To forge partnerships that matter allowing us to make tangible differences in the lives of those we help.</li>
            <li>To make a beautiful difference.</li>
