            <p>The Northern Hope Foundation began in early 2013 as a humble soup kitchen for the elderly. Moved by the sight of seniors waiting nearby for their pension grants, founder Pinky recognized that waiting is hard—but doing so on an empty stomach is even harder. With compassion and initiative, she began serving meals to those in line.</p>
            <p>What Pinky may not have realized at the time was how vital her role would become in the community. Since then, the Northern Hope Foundation—still led by Pinky—has grown significantly over the past eight years. Now a registered non-profit organization (NPO), it is dedicated to supporting the elderly, youth, and vulnerable populations in Ga-Rankuwa.</p>
            <p>The Foundation plays a key role in mobilizing the community to ensure access to vital information about HIV prevention, care and support. In collaboration with Phedisong 1, Phedisong 4, Garankuwa View and Maria Rantho Clinics, the Foundation oversees the Central Chronic Medicine Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) program including the Center for Disease and Control (CDC) program on behalf of the Department of Health, with Wits RHI serving as a mentoring and support partner.</p>
            <p>Additionally, in partnership with Wits RHI, the Foundation reaches out to communities to raise awareness about new HIV prevention strategies—including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for adolescent girls, young women, and their partners. This initiative is championed by influential community figures such as religious leaders, traditional healers, and political representatives.</p>
