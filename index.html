            <h4 class="subtitle">Planting Seeds of Hope, Nurturing Lives.</h4>
            <p>Northern Hope Foundation (NHF) is a vibrant, community-rooted non-profit organization based in Ga-Rankuwa. Established to bring lasting change to the lives of the vulnerable, NHF is committed to restoring dignity, empowering communities, and creating safe, nurturing spaces for the elderly, children, and those living with chronic conditions.</p>
            <p>We are proudly working in collaboration with Wits RHI and the Department of Health (DoH), supporting key health programs such as PrEP, CCMDD, and adherence clubs. Through these partnerships, we extend care, medication access, and counseling support to the heart of the community—ensuring no one is left behind.</p>
            <p>Our work includes food security projects, home visits, after-school support, psycho-social services, skills development, and health campaigns. Every initiative we run is rooted in hope and powered by a team that truly cares.</p>
            <p>At NHF, we believe that when communities rise together, lasting impact is inevitable.</p>

            <h2 class="sectionTitle">About Us</h2>
            <p>The Northern Hope Foundation began in early 2013 as a humble soup kitchen for the elderly. Moved by the sight of seniors waiting nearby for their pension grants, founder Pinky recognized that waiting is hard—but doing so on an empty stomach is even harder. With compassion and initiative, she began serving meals to those in line.</p>
            <p>What Pinky may not have realized at the time was how vital her role would become in the community. Since then, the Northern Hope Foundation—still led by Pinky—has grown significantly over the past eight years. Now a registered non-profit organization (NPO), it is dedicated to supporting the elderly, youth, and vulnerable populations in Ga-Rankuwa.</p>
            <p>The Foundation plays a key role in mobilizing the community to ensure access to vital information about HIV prevention, care and support. In collaboration with Phedisong 1, Phedisong 4, Garankuwa View and Maria Rantho Clinics, the Foundation oversees the Central Chronic Medicine Dispensing and Distribution (CCMDD) program including the Center for Disease and Control (CDC) program on behalf of the Department of Health, with Wits RHI serving as a mentoring and support partner.</p>
            <p>Additionally, in partnership with Wits RHI, the Foundation reaches out to communities to raise awareness about new HIV prevention strategies—including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for adolescent girls, young women, and their partners. This initiative is championed by influential community figures such as religious leaders, traditional healers, and political representatives.</p>
